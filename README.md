## Description:
The seventh project of The Odin Project and the last project of the "Intermediate HTML and CSS Course". A more complex web layout that utilizes Grid, FlexBox, SVGs and a variety of intermediate HTML/CSS concepts.

## Skills:
This project tested my knowledge of CSS Grid and FlexBox and gave me an opportunity to combine the two to create more complex layouts. I got significant practice building a website from scratch to match a given project design. 

## Reflection:
This project definitely took longer than I anticipated as there were many different icons and images that I had to find, input, and edit to match the design file given. It also took a bit of debugging to get to the correct layout by blending Grid and FlexBox.
